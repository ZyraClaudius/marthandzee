      <h2>When do I need to RSVP by?</h2>
      <p>
        We&apos;d like to know by the 1st May, but the beauty of having such a
        relaxed wedding is that if there&apos;s any emergencies then you can
        just give one of us a call and we can probably sort it.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the dress code?</h2>
      <p>
        Please wear whatever you&apos;re comfortable in, but think smart, garden
        party, festival vibes. Bear in mind that the ceremony and the reception
        are both held mostly outside so bring some layers for the nippy Cornish
        night. Costume changes and silly hats are not essential but encouraged!
        As much of the event is on grass and gravel, please wear sensible shoes.
      </p>
      <h2>Can I bring a plus one?</h2>
      <p>
        We may be able to accomodate some plus ones so please contact us if
        you&apos;d like to bring a plus one and we&apos;ll see what we can do.
      </p>
      <h2>Will transport be provided?</h2>
      <p>
        Parking at the venue is very limited so will only be available to a few
        guests, so we&apos;ll let you know if you can park at Nanspean. For
        those who can&apos;t park, there is parking in Helston and there will be
        a shuttle to and from Nanspean Farm. We&apos;ll have more details on
        this soon.
      </p>
      <h2>Do I need to bring anything?</h2>
      <p>
        We&apos;re not bothered about gifts or cards. Instead as the food is a
        buffet-style potluck, we would love for you to bring a dish for sharing.
        Though there will be drinks provided, if you could bring some of your
        own to contribute, that would be appreciated.
      </p>
      <h2>Where do I stay? (sleepwise)</h2>
      <p>
        There will be limited availability for some to camp (if you can camp
        then we&apos;ll let you know). For those who aren&apos;t camping, there
        are many AirBnBs and guest houses in Helston, Porthleven and the local
        area. Note the shuttle will only go to Helston so it may be worth
        researching travel options before you book accomodation as public
        transport in Cornwall leaves much to be desired. Also, demand for
        acommodation in Cornwall is high during the Summer so try and book early
        to avoid disappointment.
